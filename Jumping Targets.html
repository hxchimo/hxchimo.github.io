<p>The song is about a girl who falls in love with her friend 
<br>and she didn’t realize she was in love 
<br>but once she did she was afraid of telling them
<br>and so she decided to keep it a secret and continues to be in love. </p>

<span id="verse1">
<p> I was hanging with you<br>
And then I realized<br>
I didn't think it was true<br>
I was surprised<br>
When I found out I'd fallen for you<br>
I didn't wanna believe<br>
My feelings for you<br>
I didn't wanna believe<br>
That I could lose you<br>
If I told you just how I felt<br> </p>
</span>
<span id="verse2">
But I can't help it<br>
I'm falling for you<br>
And I can't quit it<br>
'Cause I'm stuck on you<br>
And it might be pathetic<br>
And you might be skeptical<br>
But I just want to be with you<br>
Please tell me boy can you<br>
Get a clue or come through<br>
'Cause I just want to be with you<br>
</span>
<br>
<span id="bridge">
I'm scared...<br>
Of telling you how I feel<br>
Maybe<br>
It's better<br>
If I just try to conceal<br>
The truth<br>
For me<br>
And for you<br>
</span>
<br>
<span id="outro">
But I'm still stuck on you<br>
I<br>
I'm still falling for you<br>
...for you<br>
